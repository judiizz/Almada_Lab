There will be four file systems:
/home1
/project/aealmada_561/
/scratch1
/scratch2

The two scratch systems are intended for temporary files, need periodically backup.
Better to do work under project folder.
```{commands}
# quick access scratch1 directory
cds

# quick access scratch2 directory
cds2

# to access the project directory
cd /project/aealmada_561
```
