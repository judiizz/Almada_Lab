# Almada_Lab


The CARC_setup.Rmd includes all my commands to set up the server (Discovery Cluster)
The install_nextflow.Rmd is for installing the nextflow
The chipseq_pipeline.Rmd is for the chipseq pipeline that includes the scripts for all the requried files

Here's the chipseq pipeline code from the course
https://github.com/boulderrinnlab/CLASS_2023/blob/master/CLASSES/03_Nextflow/02_input_files_nextflow_chipseq_pipeline.Rmd

The nextflow.out is the output files of chipseq pipeline. It shows the error messages

I followed the nextflow.out and found the main.nf file and .nextflow.log file. I copied the files here. I don't understand the error, because the main.nf file is created by nf_core chipseq, seems like I cannot control it. That's why I was wondering it might be caused by the nf_core chipseq version.
