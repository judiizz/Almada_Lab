I've been trying to debug the ChipSeq pipeline in the past two weeks. I've updated the nf_core version to 2.0.0 and modified several parameters. The error occured last time was solved! I think I made some progress, but I met new errors I think were related to the chipseq parameters. 

In this folder:
Week_6.26 and Week_7.3 are the notebooks that record my work step by step
Design.csv, nextflow.config, and run.sh are files for chipseq pipeline
nextflow.out file shows the error messages
