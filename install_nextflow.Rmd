The CARC server doesn't have nextflow
This link is very helpful for installation: 
https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html


Check requirement for nextflow: java 11 or later is required
the CARC server doesn't have java
```{commands}
# install java through SDKMAN
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk install java 17.0.6-amzn
```

Install nextflow
```{commands}
# create a "bin" directory within your home directory
mkdir bin
cd bin

# install nextflow
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

Add nextflow to path
```{commands}
# check all the paths
echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"

# will show these, make sure there is a line that says "/usr/bin"

# /home1/difeizhu/.sdkman/candidates/java/current/bin
# /spack/2206/apps/linux-centos7-x86_64_v3/gcc-11.3.0/pmix-3.2.3-o4owkss/bin
# /spack/2206/apps/linux-centos7-x86_64_v3/gcc-11.3.0/openmpi-4.1.4-4w23jca/bin
# /spack/2206/apps/linux-centos7-x86_64_v3/gcc-11.3.0/openblas-0.3.21-afcoykn/bin
# /spack/apps/gcc/11.3.0/bin
# /spack/utilities
# /usr/local/bin
# /usr/bin
# /usr/local/sbin
# /usr/sbin
# /home1/difeizhu/.local/bin
# /home1/difeizhu/bin

```

Now add nextflow to our .profile file
the .profile is loaded each time you login to the terminal

there are several . files loaded in each shell session:

.bash_profile
.profile (main simple path to bin directory)
.bshrc (set up for bash in fiji - prompts env etc)

these default in different order depending on which type of shell you are connecting with.

```{commands}
nano .profile
export PATH=$PATH:/home1/difeizhu/bin

# type this command if nextflow is not automatically launched each time when start the terminal
source ~/.profile 
```

check the nextflow: should see something like this
```{commands}
# difeizhu@discovery1 bin]$ nextflow -version
#     N E X T F L O W
#     version 23.04.2 build 5870
#     created 08-06-2023 08:29 UTC (01:29 PDT)
#     cite doi:10.1038/nbt.3820
#     http://nextflow.io
```


For nextflow update
```{commands}
nextflow self-update
```
